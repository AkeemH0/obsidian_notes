Digital video cameras that capture and transmit video and audio data over a computer network or the internet. IP cameras can be wired or wireless and can be easily integrated into [[IP (Internet protocol)]] networks for remote monitoring and recording. 
- Capture video and audio as digital data which is compressed and transmitted over an IP network typically using [[Ethernet]] cables or [[Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)]]
- IP cameras can be access and controlled remotely over the internet or a local network allowing users to view live video feeds and manage camera settings from anywhere with network connectivity e.g. Ring doorbell cameras
- IP cameras offer various resolutions including HD & 4K
- Some IP cameras utilise [[Power over Ethernet (PoE)]] allowing them to receive power through the same Ethernet cable used for data transmission which simplifies installation and reduces the need for separate power sources
- They provide features such as motion detection, night vision and remote monitoring
