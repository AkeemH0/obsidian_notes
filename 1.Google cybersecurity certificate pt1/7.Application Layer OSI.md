Topmost layer of the OSI & TCP/IP, Handles user-level processes and applications, including web browsers, email clients and other software.

Security here focuses on securing these applications, including authentication, data encryption and protection against common application-layer attacks like [[SQLi (Structured Query Language Injection)]] or [[XSS (cross-site scripting)]]
- includes protocols such as, email ([[SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)]], [[SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure)]], [[POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)]] ,[[IMAP (Internet Message Access protocol)]]), web browsing ([[HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)]], [[HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)]]), file transfer ([[FTP (File Transfer Protocol)]], [[SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)]], [[FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)]]), domain name resolution ([[DNS (Domain Name System)]], [[DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)]]), remote access ([[SSH (Secure Shell)]], [[Telnet]], [[SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)]])
- These protocols define the rules and conventions for formatting data, establishing and managing communication sessions and ensuring the secure transmission of information
- Security considerations at the Application Layer are critical, including encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data during transmission
