*where of the attack*
All the potential *vulnerabilities/entry points* that a threat actor could exploit e.g. [[attack vectors ]]: Networks, servers, devices, staff, ports, application code
[[physical attack surface]]
digital attack surface
Deconstructing a network into smaller segments for attack surface analysis is essential

Attack surfaces can be minimised throughout:
- Restricting access
- Removing unnecessary software & hardware
- Disabling unused protocols
- Auditing code
- Blocking ports on firewall
- Monitoring real-time network traffic
