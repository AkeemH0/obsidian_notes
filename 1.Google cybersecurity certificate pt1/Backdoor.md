Weaknesses intentionally left by hackers, programs or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms such as authentication.
Back doors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks but they are poor programming practice as they create vulnerabilities.
- An organization may have security measures such as cameras, biometric scans and access codes to keep employees  from entering and exiting without being seen.
- If an employee works around security measures by finding a backdoor to the building that isn't heavily monitored allowing them to sneak out for the afternoon without being seen.

Backdoors can be installed by attackers after they've compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access e.g. [[RAT (Remote access trojan)]].
Once a malicious actor has entered a backdoor they could install [[malware]], perform a [[DoS (Denial of service)]], steal private information or change other security setting that leaves the system vulnerable to other attacks.
