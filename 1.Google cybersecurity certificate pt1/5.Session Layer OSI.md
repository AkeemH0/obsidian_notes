Establishes, maintains and terminates communication sessions between applications on different device throughout establishing open sessions which can be maintained during data transfer and terminated once data transfer is complete. It manages dialog control and synchronization between applications.

The session layer is also responsible for activities such as authentication, reconnection and setting checkpoints during a data transfer. If a session is interrupted, checkpoints ensure that the transmission pick up at the last session checkpoint when the connection resumes. Sessions include a request and response between applications. Functions in the session layer respond to requests for service from processes in the [[6.Presentation Layer OSI]] and send requests for services to the [[4.Transport Layer OSI]] .
