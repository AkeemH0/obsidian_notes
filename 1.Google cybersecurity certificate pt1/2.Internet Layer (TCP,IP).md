Third layer of the TCP/IP model, also known as the Network layer in the OSI model. Plays a pivotal role in the transmission of data across interconnected networks, enabling communication between devices on different networks. The primary purpose of the internet layer is to facilitate routing and forwarding of data [[packet]]s from a source device to a destination device through potentially multiple intermediary routers.
