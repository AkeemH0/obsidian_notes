**Definition:**Â 
 A symmetric key algorithm used for encryption and decryption of electronic data.

[[symmetric encryption]], [[block cipher]], 64-bit blocks, 64-bit key (effective key strength of 56-bit as 8 bits used for parity)
Uses 16 rounds of transposition and substitution to create ciphertext
8 bits used for [[parity]]
outdated (64 bits is insecure)
