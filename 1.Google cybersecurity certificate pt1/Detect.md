Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. e.g. reviewing a new security tools setup to make sure its flagging low, medium and high risks and then alerting the security team about any potential threats or incidents. 



Design and implement a system with tools needed for detecting threats and attacks:

- Anomalies and events: What tools could be used to detect and alert IT security staff of anomalies and security events, such as a security information and event management system (SIEM) tool?
    
- Security continuous monitoring: What tools or IT processes are needed to monitor the network for security events?
    
- [[Detection (IR)]] process: What tools are needed to detect security events, such as an [[IDS (Intrusion detection system)]]?
