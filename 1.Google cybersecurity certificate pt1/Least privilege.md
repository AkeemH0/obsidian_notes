concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task 
*e.g. ensuring customer service can only access private data of a customer such as their number while working to resolve the customers issue hence access will be removed once the issue is resolved.* 
Also known as [[Principle of least privilege (POPL)]]
