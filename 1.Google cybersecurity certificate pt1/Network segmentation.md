- A security technique that divides the network into segments/[[subnet]]s via [[Subnetting]], each with their own security controls
- E.G. a hotel that offers free [[Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)]], the unsecured guest network is kept separate from the encrypted network used by the hotel staff
[[physical segmentation]] 
[[logical segmentation]] 
Benefits:
- Performance: Separate High-bandwidth applications with dedicated subnets
- Security: network separation e.g. users shouldn't be able to communicate directly to a database server, there should be a proxy/firewall im-between that filters/sanitizes requests & logs & denies/grants access to specific records
- Compliance: [[PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)]] compliance by separating credit card information from other areas of the network
