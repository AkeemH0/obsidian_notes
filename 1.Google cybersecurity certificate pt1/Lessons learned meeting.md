Also known as a post-mortem
- Incident is reviewed to determine what happened, what actions were taken and how well the actions worked . 
- Used to identify any areas of improvement not to assign blame (identify errors in response actions, gaps in processes and procedures, ineffective security controls, improving playbook instructions or implementing new security tools and technologies).

Common questions: What happened?, What time did it happen?, Who discovered it?, How did it get contained?, What were the actions taken for recovery? & What could have been done differently?.
