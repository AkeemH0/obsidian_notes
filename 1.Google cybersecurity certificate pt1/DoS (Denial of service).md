**Definition:**Â 
 An attack aimed at making a system or network unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic.

Floods a network/server with traffic resulting in the server/network being unable to respond to legitimate users or the server/network crashing leading to downtime, disrupting the organizations operations as legitimate users will not be able to access the service. Costs money and time.
Can be used as a smokescreen for another exploit
[[DDoS (distributed denial of service attack)]] are usually more effective then [[DoS (Denial of service)]] as they utilize multiple devices to overload.
[[ICMP flood Attack]]
[[SYN flood attacks (targeting TCP)]]
[[Ping of death]]

[[Defence in depth]] is crucial as there isn't one perfect strategy for stopping every kind of attack but layering multiple strategies will reduce amount of [[vulnerabilities]] that can be exploited.
