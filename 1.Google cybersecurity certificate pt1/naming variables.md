- Use only letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. Valid examples: date_3, username, interval2

- Start a variable name with a letter or underscore. Do not start it with a number. Valid examples: time,  _login

- Remember that variable names in Python are case-sensitive. These are all different variables: time, Time, TIME, timE.

- Don't use Python’s built-in keywords or functions for variable names. For example, variables shouldn't be named True, False, or if.  

- Separate two or more words with underscores. Valid examples: login_attempts_,_ invalid_user_,_ status_update
  
- Another convention that you might encounter is capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first word. Example: loginAttempt
 
- Avoid variables with similar names. These variables could be easily confused with one another: start_time, starting_time, time_starting.

- Avoid unnecessarily long names for variables. For instance, don't give variables names like variable_that_equals_3.

- Names should describe the data and not be random words. Valid examples: num_login_attempts, device_id, invalid_usernames
