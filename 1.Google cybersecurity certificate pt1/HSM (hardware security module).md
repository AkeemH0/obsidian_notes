**Definition:**Â 
 A physical device providing secure key storage and cryptographic operations, often used to protect sensitive information.

Tamper-resistant storage
Securely stores thousands of cryptographic keys
HSMs are usually stored in clusters & have redundant power
Separate plug-in card / hardware device to perform cryptographic functions
Cryptographic accelerators can be used to speed up key encryption/decryption
Used to store keys about highly sensitive data such as bank transactions
*like a more larger [[TPM (Trusted platform module)]] with more features*
