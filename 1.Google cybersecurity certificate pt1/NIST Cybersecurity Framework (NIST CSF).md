[[NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)]] CSF
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
Used to secure information.
composed of:
- Core: a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organisations customize their security plan
- Tiers: Assess an organizations [[security posture]] and identify areas for improvement.
- Profiles: pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry.
The **NIST CSF core** has 5 functions:
- [[Identify]] assets
- [[Protect]] assets
- [[Detect]] attacks
- [[Respond]] to attacks
- [[Recover]]y plans

**Tiers** provide security teams with a way to measure performance across each of the different functions of the NIST CSF core. Tiers range from Level-1 ((passive) indicates a function is reaching bare minimum standards) to Level-4 ((adaptive) Indicates that a function is being performed at an exemplary standard). 

Profiles provide insight into the current state of a security plan.
They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.
Like photos capturing a moment in time, comparing photos of the same subject taken at different time can provide useful insights. Without these ''photos'' you may not realise how the NIST profiles have changed.


Organisations may choose to use the CSF to achieve compliance with a variety of regulations (regulations must be followed while frameworks are resources that you can choose to use to improve security (which commonly overlap with regulations))

CSF can be challenging to implement due to its high level of detail.
Overview of recommendations:
- Create a current profile of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
- Performs a risk assessment to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards
- Analyse and prioritize existing gaps in security operations that place the business assets at risk
- Implement a plan of action to achieve your organizations goals and objectives

Always consider current risk, threat and vulnerability trends when using the NIST CSF.

NIST CSF framework aligns with the security practices of many organizations across the global economy. It also helps with regulatory compliance that might be shared by business partners.
