- Intercepting network traffic & stealing valuable information or interfering with the transmission in some way.
- Can be carried out via hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit ([[packet sniffing]])e.g. [[wireshark]]
- Network traffic can also be altered via inserting [[malware]] or altering the message and interrupting network operations e.g. The attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the receiving account to one that the attacker controls.
