Ensures end-to-end communication between two devices. Responsible for segmenting and reassembling data, error checking and flow control. The segments need to be reassembled at their destination so they can be processed at the [[5.Session Layer OSI]]. The speed and rate of transmission also has to match the connection speed of the destination system.

E.G. [[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]] & [[UDP (User Datagram Protocol)]] are common protocols 
port numbers
Usually first layer analysed for network issues
If no issues go up OSI layers (session, presentation, application)
If issues go down OSI layers (physical, data, network)
