**Definition:**
 A technique/proxy that modifies network address information in packet headers while in transit to convert between public and private IP addresses.

- A technique used in routers in the [[3.Network Layer OSI]] to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP addresses for internet communication allowing multiple devices to share the same singular public IP address for internet access. 
- Often implemented in gateway devices like routers or firewalls which contain a NAT table which keeps track of mapping between [[Private IP]] & [[Public IP]] addresses and ports.
- Enhances security by hiding internal network devices from the external network.
- It's commonly used in home and small office networks to conserve public [[IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)]] addresses.
