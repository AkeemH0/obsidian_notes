Data that's actively being processed: created, retrieved, changed/updated or deleted
Data has to be decrypted to be processed therefore direct encryption methods aren't effective and attackers often try to obtain access to ram to see decrypted information

Ensuring confidentiality:
Application level encryption
[[Access control]]
[[Secure enclave]]
[[Intel software guard]]
