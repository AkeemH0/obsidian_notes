[[open-source]] [[intelligence]]
The collection and analysis of [[information]] from publicly available sources to generate usable [[intelligence]].
Its commonly used to support cybersecurity activities, like identifying potential threats, threat actors and vulnerabilities.
Businesses often use information to gain insights into the behaviour of their customers, so that they can improve decision making.
In security, open-source information is used to gain insight into threats and vulnerabilities that can pose risks to an organization.
OSINT plays a significant role in [[InfoSec]], which is the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users. e.g. a companies InfoSec team may utilize OSINT to monitor online forums and hacker communities for discussions about emerging vulnerabilities so that they can discover weaknesses, assess the risk, prioritize patching efforts and implement necessary safeguards to prevent an attack.
ways OSINT can generate intelligence:
- To provide insights into cyber attacks
- To detect potential data exposures
- To evaluate existing defences
- To identify unknown vulnerabilities
Generating intelligence is part of [[vulnerability management]].
Security teams may use OSINT to develop profiles of potential targets and make data driven decisions on improving their defences.

OSINT Tools:
Virus Total: analyses suspicious files, domains, URLs and IP addresses for malicious content
MITRE ATT&CK: knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques
OSINT Framework: OSINT tools for different sources and platforms
