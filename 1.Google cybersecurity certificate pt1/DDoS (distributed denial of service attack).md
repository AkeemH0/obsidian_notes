**Definition:**Â 
 An attack where multiple compromised computers are used to flood a target system with traffic, causing a disruption in service.

A cyberattack that aims to overwhelm a target system, network or service with a flood of traffic from multiple sources. The goal is to disrupt the availability of the target making it inaccessible to legitimate users.
Asymmetric threat as attackers often have fewer resources than victim
**Attack Mechanism**
- DDoS attacks involve a large number of compromised devices, often part of a botnet, that are coordinated to send a massive volume of traffic to a target.
- The traffic can be in the form of HTTP requests, UDP, TCP or other protocols and it can flood the target's network bandwidth, processing capacity or application layer
**Types of DDoS attacks**
- [[volume-based DDoS]]
- [[protocol-based DDoS]]
- [[application layer DDoS]]
- [[amplifications attacks (using UDP)]]
- [[DDoS reflection and amplification]]
**Impact of DDoS Attacks**
- DDoS attacks can lead to service disruption, financial losses and reputational damage for organizations
- Attackers may use DDoS attacks as a smokescreen to distract from other malicious activities or to extort money from victims
**Mitigation and Defence**
- Organizations can implement various DDoS mitigation strategies, including traffic filtering, rate limiting and the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) to absorb traffic
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and web application firewalls (WAFs) can help detect and block DDoS traffic
- DDoS mitigation devices from third-party providers can also be used to absorb attack traffic
