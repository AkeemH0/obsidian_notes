Authorize users and services to have access to certain types of data and applications.

- Associating individual users to access rights doesn't scale so define authorization by roles/organisations/attributes using groups.
- Reduces complexity throughout abstraction; creates clear relationship between user and resources
- Streamlines administration - easy to understand authorization & supports a large number of users or resources
