**Definition:**Â 
 A security model where the owner of an object (e.g., file or resource or system) controls its access permissions.

- When a data owner/custodian decides appropriate access permissions
- e.g. when the google driver folder owner shares: editor, viewer or commentor access 
- flexible but less secure as you're relying on the owners to set appropriate access control
