Can be carried out digitally & physically
A trial-and-error process of discovering private information.
- [[Simple brute force attack]]
- [[Dictionary attack]]
- [[Reverse brute force attack]]
- [[Credential stuffing]]
An attacker can use brute force attack to gain access and compromise (weaken) a network
manually carrying out brute force attacks can be time consuming and tedious thus hackers often use a range of tools & try to obtain a list of users and hashes to compare a calculated password hash to.
prevention measures:
- [[Salting]] and [[Hashing]] : salting increases the length and complexity of hash values (longer input usually results in longer hash values) making them harder to brute force and less susceptible to dictionary attacks.
- [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]] & [[two-factor authentication (2FA)]]
- [[CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart)]] and [[reCAPTCHA]]
- password policies: Organizations implement password policies to standardize strong password practices throughout the business such as password complexity guidelines and how often users need to change their passwords and if there are limits to how many times a user can attempt to log into a system before being blocked.
- analysts use [[sandbox]]es and [[VM (Virtual machine)]] to protect against brute force attacks
[[Caesar cipher]] is vulnerable to brute force attacks
The longer the key length the slower the processing time is but the more secure the key is (less prone to brute force attacks e.g. long passwords) since the attacker will have to try more possibilities.

Since brute forcing a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, attackers often use software to do the guess work for them:
- Aircrack-ng e.g. to test a Wi-Fi network for vulnerabilities to a brute force attack
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper
- Ophcrack
- THC Hydra

Physical brute force attacks
- [[Forcible entry]]
 - [[Tampering with security devices]]
 - [[Confronting security personnel]]
 - [[Ramming a barrier with a vehicle]]

Brute forcing has improved due to increased GPU processing speeds & Cloud-based password cracking
