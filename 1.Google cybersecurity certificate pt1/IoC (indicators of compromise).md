**Definition:**Â 
 Artifacts or behaviours that suggest a system has been compromised or is under attack.

Pieces of information or artifacts that suggest a security incident or cybersecurity breach, often used to detect and investigate potential threats. IOCs can include various data types, such as file hashes, IP addresses, URLs, or patterns in the code.

Observable evidence that suggest signs of a potential security incident.
- Chart specific pieces of evidence associated with an attack e.g. file name associated with a type of malware
- Don't always confirm that a security incident has happened; IOCs may be a result of human error or system malfunctions
