**Definition:**Â 
 A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm providing strong security for data transmission and storage.

[[symmetric encryption]], [[block cipher]]
- one of the most secure symmetric algorithms.  
- Generates keys that are 128,192 or 256 bits (keys of this size are considered to be safe from brute force attacks)
- Its estimated that brute forcing an AES 128-bit key could take a modern computer billions of years
- Commonly used for data at rest
