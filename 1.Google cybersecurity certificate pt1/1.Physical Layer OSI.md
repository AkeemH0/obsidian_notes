Deals with the physical hardware aspects of network communication. It defines the electrical, mechanical and physical characteristics of the transmission medium such as cables connectors and [[Network interface card (NIC)]]s.
To travel across an ethernet or coaxial cable a data packet needs to be translate into a stream of 0s and 1s ([[bit]]s). The stream of 0s and 1s are sent across the physical wiring and cables, received and then passed onto higher levels of the OSI model.
E.G. [[Hub]]s, [[Modem]]s, [[Ethernet]], [[coaxial cable]]
