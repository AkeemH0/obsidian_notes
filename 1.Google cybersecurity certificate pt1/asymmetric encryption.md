Also known as public-key cryptography
Public key & Private key pair for encryption & decryption
Both keys can encrypt, keys are mathematically related
Public key can be used to send an encrypted message which can only be decoded by private key
Private key can be used to verify the sender (known as a signature) by sending an encrypted message which can only be decrypted by the public key of the supposed sender
Slower process than [[symmetric encryption]] (symmetric algorithms are 100 to 1000x time quicker)
[[Hybrid implementation]]
- [[DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)]]
- [[ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)]]
- [[RSA (Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman)]]
- [[DSA (Digital signature algorithm)]]
