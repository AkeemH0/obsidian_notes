A structured & documented set of procedures guidelines & predefined actions that an organization follows when responding to cybersecurity incidents.
Incident response documentation should cover the 5W's (who, what, where, why & when)

6 phases of an incident response playbook ([[NIST Incident Response Lifecycle]]):

 - **Preparation** : organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk & impact of a security incident by documenting procedures establishing staffing plans and educating users.

 - **Detection and analysis**: use of tools to detect whether a breach has occurred and analyse its possible magnitude 

 - **containment**: prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident. Containment is crucial as it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data 

 - **Eradication and recovery**: the complete removal of an incidents artefacts so that an organisation can return to normal operations ([[business continuity]]). Artefacts of the incident are removed e.g. malicious code & vulnerabilities are mitigated. Once removed, the affected environment can be restored to a secure state ([[IT Restoration]])

 - **Post incident activity**: documenting the incident , informing organizational leadership, applying lessons learned to ensure that an organisation is better prepared to handle future incidents. Organisation may carry out a full scale incident analysis to identify the root cause to implement various updates or improvements to enhance [[security posture ]] 

 - **coordination**: reporting incidents and sharing information throughout the incident response process, based on the organizations established standards. It ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements & allows for coordinated response and resolution.
