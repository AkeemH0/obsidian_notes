Virtual Systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders so that you can learn what type of security techniques they are trying to use against you.
Most "attackers" are automated machines
Constant battle to work out the real from the fake so we must constantly make them more realistic 
Can be used to detect [[Internal threat actors]] conducting fraud, snooping and malpractice
E.G. fake file labelled Client Credit Card Information can be used to capture activity of malicious actors by tricking them into accessing the file because it appears to be legitimate. Once a malicious actor tries to access this file, security teams are alerted.
[[Honeynet]]
Should be stored in a screened subnet or isolated segment of the network that can be easily accessed by attackers over the internet
Double-edged sword as can be used to learn how production systems are configured
