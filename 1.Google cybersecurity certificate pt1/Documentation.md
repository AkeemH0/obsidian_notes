Effective documentation has three benefits:
 - Transparency: crucial for demonstrating compliance with regulations and internal processes, meeting insurance requirements & for legal proceedings.
 - Standardization:  [[Standard]]ization through repeatable processes and procedures supports continuous improvement efforts, maintains consistency ,helps with knowledge transfer & facilitates the onboarding of new team members. E.G. an [[IRP (incident response plan)]] establishes standardization
 - Clarity: Helps people quickly access the information they need so they can take necessary action. Security analysts are required to document the reasoning behind any action they take so that it's clear to their team why an alert was escalated or closed.

Documentation ensures:
 - Integrity
 - Reliability
 - Accuracy

Best practices for creating documentation:

 - Know your audience: Adjust terminology based on audience 

 - Be concise: Establish the purpose immediately to help people identify the objective of the document. The document should allow people to skim it for key findings. 

 - Update regularly: Documentation must be reviewed and updated to  keep up with the evolving threat landscape. E.G. after an incident a comprehensive review of the incident can identify gaps in processes and procedures that require changes and updates. By regularly updating documentation, security teams stay well informed and incident response plans stay updated.
