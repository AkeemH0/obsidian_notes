A type of electrical cable that consists of a central conductor, an insulating layer, a metallic shield and an outer insulating layer that is designed for transmitting electrical signals including audio,  video and data while providing protection against external interference and signal loss.
- Central conductor: A solid or stranded wire at the core of the cable typically made of copper or aluminium which carries electrical signals.
- Insulating Layer: Surrounding the central conductor is an insulating layer, usually made of plastic, rubber or foam. It isolates the central conductor from the outer shield
- Metallic shield: A metallic layer, often made of copper or aluminium which surrounds the insulating layer. It serves as a shield to protect the inner conductor from electromagnetic interference (EMI) & [[radio frequency interference (RFI)]]
- Outer Insulating Layer: Another insulating material that provides further protection and insulation. It is often made of plastic or rubber.

**Applications:**
- Cable Television
- Internet Access
- Security Cameras
- Networking (have largely been replaced by [[twisted-pair cables]])

**Types** :
- RG-6 (used for cable TV and satellite connections)
- RG-59 (often used for older cable TV installations)
- RG-11 (used for longer cable runs)

**Signal loss:**
Coaxial cables can experience signal loss, especially over longer distances thus [[signal amplifiers]] or [[Repeater]]may be used to compensate for this loss in long cable runs by regenerating/strengthening the signal.

**Connector Types**:
- F-type connectors (common in cable TV connections)
- BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) connectors (Common in networking and video applications)
