Selectively restrict access to a resource (only authorized people can access).
- [ ] [[ACL (Access control list)]]
Security controls that manage access, authorization and accountability of information
to maintain CIA 

1. [[AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)]]:

2. [[IAM (Identity and Access Management)]] framework

Two fundamental security principles that limit access to organizational resources are:
- [[Principle of least privilege (POPL)]]: when a user is granted the minimum level of access and authorization required to complete a task or function. *limits access of an individual*
- [[separation of duties]]: the principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system. *divides responsibilities*

Access control technologies:
- users experience authentication and authorization as a single, seamless experience due to access control technologies being configured to work together.
- Access control technology tools offer speed and automation needed by administrators to monitor and modify access rights
- A typical [[AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)]] or [[IAM (Identity and Access Management)]] system consists of a user [[directory]], a set of tools for managing data in that directory , an authorization system, and an auditing system.
- many organisations opt to license third party solutions that offer a suite of tools that enable them to quickly secure their information systems as it is time & resource intensive to build an in-house solution 

IAM & AAA are common frameworks for implementing least privilege and separation of duties

[[PAM (privileged access management)]]

[[RBAC (Role-based access control)]]
[[RBAC (Rule-based Access control)]]
