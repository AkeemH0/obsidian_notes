`import` searches for a module or library in a system and adds it to the local Python environment.
`from ____ import ___,___,___` to import specific function from a library
when importing a whole library you must refer to the library when calling a specific function e.g. `statistics.mean() #import statistics`
when importing individual functions from a library you needn't refer to the library e.g. `mean() #from statistics import mean,median`
