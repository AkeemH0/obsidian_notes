causing problems in a controlled environment and evaluating the outcome to gain insights
proactive simulations assume the role of an attacker by exploiting vulnerabilities and breaking through defences ([[red team]])
reactive simulations assume the role of a defender responding to an attack ([[blue team]])

1. Identify a target
2. Determine how the target can be accessed
3. Evaluate [[attack vectors]] that can be exploited
4. Find the tools and methods of attack
