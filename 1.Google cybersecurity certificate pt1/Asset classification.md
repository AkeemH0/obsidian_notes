The practice of labelling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization
Levels of asset classification (low to high):
- Public: can be shared with anyone.
- Internal-only: can be shared with anyone inside the organisation e.g. employees & business partners.
- Confidential: can only be accessed by those working on a specific project.
- Restricted/Highly confidential: Highly sensitive, can only be accessed on a [[need to know basis]] e.g. SPII.
- Critical/Top Secret: Reserved for assets critical to the survival and success of the organization e.g. national security information, advanced research & development data

knowledge needed to determine sensitivity and value of an asset:
- What you have
- Where it is
- Who owns it
- How important it is
