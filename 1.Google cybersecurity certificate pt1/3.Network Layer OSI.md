Oversees receiving the frames from the [[2.Data Link Layer OSI]] and delivers them to the intended destination (which can be found based on the address provided in the frame of the data [[packet]]). Focuses on routing and forwarding data packets between different networks. It provides logical addressing and determines the best path for data to reach its destination based on [[Destination IP Address]].
E.G. [[IP (Internet protocol)]], [[Router]]s, routing algorithms

- Organize the Addressing and delivery of data [[packet]] across the network & internet from the host device to the destination device.
- Includes [[Routing (Internet Layer)]] packets using [[routing table]]
