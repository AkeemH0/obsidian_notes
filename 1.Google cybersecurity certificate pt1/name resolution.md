Translating IP addresses & port numbers into human-readable host names or vice versa.
This can be problematic as name resolution can sometimes be inaccurate.
For example port 80 may be translated to HTTP, however this is misleading because port 80 isn't always going to be using HTTP; it could be using a different protocol.****
