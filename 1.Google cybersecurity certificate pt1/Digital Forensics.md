The practice of collecting and analysing data to determine what has happened after an attack e.g. looking at network activity logs using a packet sniffer
Notes must be detailed oriented 
All relevant data must be collected
**General Steps**:
 1. Acquire the evidence (requires search authority & devices require special handling if turned on)
 2. Digitally sign data (can see if data has been altered at any stage)
 3. Establish a [[Chain of Custody]] (ensures that only the authorized investigators had access to the evidence and no one could have tampered with it)
 4. Place the evidence in a secure container (so evidence doesn't get damaged e.g. placing a smartphone in a faraday cage to ensure it has no network access so that it can't be wiped remotely)
 5. Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab
 6. Retrieve digital evidence from secure container
 7. Create a forensic copy of the evidence (requires advanced software)
 8. Return evidence to the secure container
 9. Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation

requires proper search authority to conduct
