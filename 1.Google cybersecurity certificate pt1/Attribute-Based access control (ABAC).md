Allows resource access based on user, device and resource attributes
e.g. birthdate to check if 18+, IP address, MAC address, time of day, location, desired action
A type of [[RBAC (Rule-based Access control)]] solely based on attributes
provides granular control over access based on specific conditions
Well-suited to dynamic environments where access requirements change frequently

*like how getting through a VIP entrance is based on a combination of various attributes (receiving an invitation, looking >= 18, being on the guest list, dressing appropriately)*
