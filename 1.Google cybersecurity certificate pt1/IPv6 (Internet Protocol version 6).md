- IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of [[IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)]] addresses and offers enhanced features, including better security.
- IPv6 can have 2^128 addresses
- IPv6 header doesn't include IHL, identification and flag fields
- IPv6 header utilises Flow label which identifies a packet as requiring special handling by other IPv6 routers
-  IPv6 offers more efficient routing and eliminates private address collisions that can occur on IPv4 when two devices on the same network are attempting to use the same address
