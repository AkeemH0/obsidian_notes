- The process of collecting, storing, analysing and disposing of log data.
- Only logging useful information to prevent excess logs e.g. not logging SPII.
- Overlogging increases storage and maintenance costs & increases load on systems which could cause performance issues and affect usability making it time consuming to search for and identify important events.
- Some organizations are required to retain logs for a set period of time due to regulations. e.g. companies in: Public sector industries, Healthcare industries, Financial services industries
- Log protection is vital for maintaining log integrity as malicious actors could modify logs in attempts to mislead security teams and hide their activity.
- Storing logs in a dedicated centralized server instead of on a local machine helps to maintain log integrity since there is a barrier between the attacker and the log location.
