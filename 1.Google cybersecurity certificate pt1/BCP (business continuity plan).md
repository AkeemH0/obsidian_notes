**Definition:**Â 
 A comprehensive strategy outlining procedures and resources to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disaster or disruption.
A document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption.
Prolonged disruption of systems and services can cause legal, financial and reputational damage. 
Helps organizations ensure that critical business functions can resume or be quickly restored when an incident occurs.

Note: Business continuity plans != [[DRP (disaster recovery plan)]]
1. Conduct a business impact analysis : focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization.
2. Identify, document, and implement steps to recover critical business functions and processes: helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event
3. Organize a business continuity team: brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan, if it is needed.
4. Conduct training for the business continuity team: The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during these training exercises.


Security incidents targeting the assets, systems and networks of critical infrastructure can compromise national security, economic security and the health and safety of the public. Therefore BCPs are crucial for minimizing interruptions to operations so that essential services can be accessed.

BCPs should contain recovery strategies such as:
Site resilience: resilience the ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from disruption. An example is site resilience which ensures the availability of networks, data centres or other infrastructure when a disruption happens

Types of recovery sites used or site resilience:
Hot sites: A fully operational facility that is a duplicate of an organizations primary environment. Can be activated immediately when an organizations primary site experiences failure or disruption.
Warm sites: A facility that contains a fully updated and configured version of the hot site. Unlike hot sites, warm sites are not fully operational and available for immediate use but can quickly be made operational when a disruption occurs
Cold sites: A backup facility equipped with some of the necessary infrastructure required to operate an organizations site. When a disruption of failure occurs, cold sites might not be ready for immediate use and might need additional work to be operational.
