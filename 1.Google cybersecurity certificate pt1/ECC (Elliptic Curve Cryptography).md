**Definition:**Â 
 A public-key cryptography approach using elliptic curves over finite fields, providing strong security with shorter key lengths.

[[asymmetric encryption]] often used in mobile devices & low-power computing devices
~ 6x more efficient than RSA (256-bit ECC key just as secure as 2048-bit RSA key with only 1/6th the computational overhead (1/6th processing power requirements)) 
based on the algebraic structure of elliptical curves over finite fields to define keys
