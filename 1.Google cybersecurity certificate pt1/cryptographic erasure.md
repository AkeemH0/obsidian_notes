Encrypting data before deleting it and disposing the keys to prevent advanced data recovery techniques from retrieving the data (if the data is somehow retrieved it will still be encrypted)
- Crypto shredding is the practice of permanently erasing both encryption and decryption keys, rendering data indecipherable. 
- This technique is employed when data must be securely deleted without future retrieval. 
- Complex encryption is applied to data, and then both keys are deleted to prevent unauthorized access.
