**Definition:**Â 
 A security process that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification before granting access.

A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in several ways to access a system or network e.g. something you know (username/password), something you have (ID card/phone SMS/one-time password OTP sent to phone number or email), something you are (fingerprint/biometric/facial recognition), something you do & somewhere you are.
Requires an additional step beyond entering username and password to gain access to an application

- Something a user is (characteristic): e.g. biometrics (fingerprint or facial scan)
- Somewhere you are
