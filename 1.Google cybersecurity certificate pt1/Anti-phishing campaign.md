Educating individuals about phishing risks and how to recognize potential phishing attempts 
Should cover:
- Types of phishing
- Simulated phishing emails e.g. ([Phish Insight](https://phishinsight.trendmicro.com/)), paired with immediate remedial training for employees who fall for attack (tests employees, [[EDR (Endpoint Detection and response)]] & [[email filtering]])
- Common characteristics of phishing:
 - Generic greetings
 - Urgency - pushing you to take immediate action
 - Unusual requests - asking for sensitive information
 - Mismatched URLs - display text != underlying URL (only seen when link hovered). brand impersonation
 - Spelling mistakes - phishing emails often contain spelling mistakes. some attackers purposefully make spelling mistakes so that they sift down the pool to more gullible people.
 - [[Email spoofing]] -  display text != underlying email (only seen when hovered), [[email phishing]]
