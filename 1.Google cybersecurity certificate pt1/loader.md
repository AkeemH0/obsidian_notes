Also known as downloader
A type of malware that downloads strains of malicious code from an external source and installs them onto a target system as additional malicious tools.
Loaders are facilitated by a [[dropper]]
Used to setup another type of malware e.g. a [[Botnet]].
Multi-staged malware attacks where multiple packets of malicious code are deployed.
typically used to spread [[Rootkit]]s

*In complex cyber-attacks, malware is often delivered in stages. Loaders are like delivery agents; they fetch more malicious code from the internet and install it on the target computer. Attackers use loaders to set up different types of malware, create networks of controlled computers (botnets), and spread hidden programs for long-term access (rootkits). So, loaders are like the messengers that bring in more bad stuff after the initial attack by the dropper*
