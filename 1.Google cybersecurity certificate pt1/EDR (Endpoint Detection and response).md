**Definition:**Â 
 A cybersecurity solution that continuously monitors and responds to security threats at the endpoint level.

A lightweight application installed on an endpoint that automatically monitors an [[endpoint]] for malicious activity.
Threat detection methods: Signatures, behavioural analysis (using machine learning & AI), process monitoring & recording.
Isolates the system, quarantines the threat, rolls back to previous config.
API driven so autonomous 
[[securing edgepoint]]


Monitor record and analyse endpoint system activity to identify alert and respond to suspicious activity. Unlike IDS or IPS tools, EDRs collect endpoint activity data and perform behavioural analysis to identify threat patterns happening on an endpoint. Behavioural analysis utilizes machine learning and AI to analyse system behaviour and identify malicious or unusual activity.

[[XDR (eXtended Detection and Response)]] is a more intelligent [[EDR (Endpoint Detection and response)]]
