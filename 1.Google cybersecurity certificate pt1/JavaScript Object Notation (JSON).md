Similar to JavaScript, JSON contains:
- Key-value pairs: a set of data that represents two linked items (A key and its corresponding value). E.G.`"Alert": "Malware"`
- Commas `,`
- Double quotes `""`
- Curly brackets: enclose an object (a data type that stores data in a comma-separated list of key value pairs.) Objects are often used to describe multiple properties for a given key.e.g. 
`  "User"
`  {`
`  "id": "1234",Â  
`  "name": "user", `
`  "role": "engineer"``
`  }`
  ``
- Square brackets: used to enclose an array (a data type that stores data in a comma-separated ordered list) E.G. `["Administrators", "Users", "Engineering"]`
