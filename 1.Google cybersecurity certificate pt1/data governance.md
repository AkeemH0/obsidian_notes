A set of processes that define how an organization manages information.
Governance often includes policies that specify how to keep data private accurate available and secure throughout its lifecycle.
data governance policies commonly categorize individuals into a specific role:
- [[Data owner]]: the person that decides who can access, edit, use or destroy their information
- [[Data custodian]]: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport and storage of information
- [[Data steward]]: the person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization.

Data governance policies often assign accountability to data owners, custodians and stewards
As a data custodian you will primarily be responsible for maintaining security and privacy rules for your organization.
