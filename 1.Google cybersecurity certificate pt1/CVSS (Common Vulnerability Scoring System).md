**Definition:**Â 
 A framework for assessing and rating the severity of security vulnerabilities.

A measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability (0-10)
Security teams use the CVSS to calculate the impact a vulnerability could have on a system & to determine how quickly a vulnerability should be patched

from an organizations standpoint: Usually critical, high & sometimes medium vulnerabilities are dealt with but medium & low are usually left (due to the ever increasing amounts of vulnerabilities, it would be impractical to patch all)
