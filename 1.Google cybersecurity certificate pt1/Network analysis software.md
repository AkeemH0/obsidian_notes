Software that captures & analyses network traffic to identify suspicious behaviour and generate network data logs. 
Can analyse live network traffic, existing packet capture files & create and save full or conditional packet captures (based on criteria such as meeting the rules of a [[signature]]).
Useful for forensics, incident response & for testing signatures.
E.G. you can trigger an alert and capture the live network traffic to generate traffic logs, which you can then analyse to refine detection signatures.
