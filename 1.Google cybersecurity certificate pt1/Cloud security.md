Shifting applications & infrastructure over to the cloud can make it easier to operate an online business but may complicate how to keep data private and safe.
Cloud security is a subfield of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud.
E.g. [[PaaS (Platform as a service)]], the client pays to access the resources they need to build their own applications so it is reasonable to expect them to be responsible for securing the applications they build. On the other hand, the responsibility for maintaining the security of the servers they are accessing should belong to the cloud service provider because there are other clients using the same systems. This is known as the [[shared responsibility model]]

Challenges:
- **Misconfiguration** (one of the biggest concerns): Customers are responsible for configuring their own security environment & oftentimes they use **out-of-the-box configurations** that fail to address their specific security objectives.
- **Cloud-native breaches** are more likely to occur due to **misconfigured services**.
- Monitoring access might be difficult depending on the client and level of service.
- Meeting regulatory standards is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as [[Health Insurance Portability And Accountability (HIPAA)]] & [[GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)]]
