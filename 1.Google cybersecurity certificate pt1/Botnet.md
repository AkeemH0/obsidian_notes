short for ''robot network''
A collection of computers or devices ([[zombie]]s) infected by malware that are controlled remotely by a bot-herder.
Each computer in a botnet can be remotely controlled (using a [[command and control (C2) node]]).
Attackers use low percentages of processing power to try to remain undetected

[[Virus]]es, [[Worm]]s and [[Trojan]]s are often used to spread the initial infection and turn infected devices into a bot for the [[bot-herder]]
The attacker uses phishing campaigns, file sharing, email or social media to spread the malware. 
When a target unknowingly opens the malicious file, the computer or bot, reports the information back the the bot-herder, who can execute commands on the infected computer.

Uses:
 - [[DDoS (distributed denial of service attack)]]: all systems send packets at the same time to a system
- hosting illegal content across a large number of device
- [[Cryptojacking]]
- Breaking encryption/password cracking using processing power of multiple machines
