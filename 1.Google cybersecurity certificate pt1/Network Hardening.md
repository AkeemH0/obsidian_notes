- [[Port Filtering]]:
- Network access privilege: permitting, limiting &or blocking access privileges to network assets for people, roles , groups, IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc. Reduces the risk of unauthorized users and outside traffic from accessing the internal network.
- Encryption: All network communication should be encrypted using the latest encryption standards
- [[Network segmentation]] should be used to create isolated [[subnet]]s for each department in an organization. Issues across each subnet don't spread across the company and users are only given access to part of the network that they require for their work ([[Principle of least privilege (POPL)]])
- Network segmentation can also be used to separate different security zones e.g. [[Demilitarized zone (DMZ)]] & [[Restricted zone]]
- Firewall rules maintenance
- [[Network log analysis]]
- [[Patch Update]]s
- Disabling unused ports: different ports have different vulnerabilities therefore reducing the amounts of ports used by an organisation can decrease its attack surface [[port vulnerabilities]]
- Server backups: help protect data assets from being lost, backups can be stored in a physical location or uploaded/synced to the cloud.
- Networks should be setup with the most up to date wireless protocols [[WPA3]] 
-  disabling unused ports
- Proper Hardware & software disposal, removing outdates/unused software & hardware to reduce the attack surface as certain devices can be more prone to security flaws especially outdates devices.
