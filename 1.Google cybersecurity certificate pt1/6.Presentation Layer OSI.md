- Deals with data format translation and encryption/decryption.
- Ensures that data sent by one application can be correctly interpreted by another, even if they use different data formats
- Adds to and replaces data with formats that can be understood by [[7.Application Layer OSI]] on both sending and receiving systems
- Formatting functions that occur at layer 6 include encryption/decryption, compression/decompression and confirmation that the character code set can be interpreted on the receiving system. 
- E.G. [[TLS (Transport Layer Security)]]/[[SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)]] encryption which encrypts data between web servers and browsers as part of websites with HTTPS, JPEG for image compression
