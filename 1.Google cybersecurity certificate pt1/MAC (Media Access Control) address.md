**Definition:**Â 
 A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on a network. Like a fingerprint.

Also known as physical address
A unique & permanent alphanumeric identifier assigned to every [[Network interface card (NIC)]] or network adapter in a device. It is hexadecimal code that serves as a means to identify devices on a local network at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the [[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)]] model.
- MAC addresses are 48bits (6 bytes) and are typically represented in hexadecimal notation e.g. 00:1A:2B:3C;4D;5E
- MAC addresses are globally unique (although there are some exceptions and special cases)
- Understanding MAC addresses is crucial for configuring and managing network devices, especially in scenarios where network access control is enforced base on MAC address
- knowing how to implement and configure [[MAC address filtering]] is crucial
- While MAC addresses are essential for [[LAN (Local Area Network)]] communication, they are typically not routable over the internet
- *Is like a fingerprint*
