occurs when an attacker is unable to directly see the results of their attack. Instead they can interpret the results by analysing the behaviour of the system.

e.g. an attacker might perform a SQL injection attack on the login form of a website that causes the system to respond with an error message. Although sensitive data isn't returned the attacker can infer the databases structure based on the error & use this information to craft attacks that will give them access to sensitive data or allow them to take control of the system
