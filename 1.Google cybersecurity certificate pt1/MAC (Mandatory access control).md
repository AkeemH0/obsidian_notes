**Definition:**Â 
 An access control security model where access permissions are determined by the **central administrator** rather than by users.
- **MAC labels:** Resources are labelled using security levels - Confidential, secret, top secret, proprietary etc.
- Authorization: based on a strict **[[need to know basis]]**; permission is based on resources being accessed and security clearance
- **Manual access grant:** Access to information must be granted manually by a central authority or system administrator
- Applications: Commonly applied in law enforcement military and other government agencies where users must access through a chain of command
- Also known as a non-discretionary control because access isn't given at the discretion (choice) of the data owner.

*like a military clearance system: the government/leader (central administrator) chooses who gets access to classified info/resources using security labels (for resources) and security clearance levels (for users)*
