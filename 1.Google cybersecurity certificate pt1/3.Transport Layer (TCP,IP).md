Manages end-to-end communication between devices and is primarily concerned with ensuring data integrity and reliability. primary protocols are [[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]] & [[UDP (User Datagram Protocol)]]. 
Security concerns include encryption and ensuring the proper functioning of TCP/IP services to prevent disruptions. this layer ensures that data is reliably and efficiently transmitted between the sender and the receiver, regardless of the complexities of the underlying network.
- Responsible for end-to-end communication by segmenting, reassembling and managing data transmission between applications or processes on different devices
- Two primary transport layer protocols are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), each with distinct characteristics:
- [[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]]
- [[UDP (User Datagram Protocol)]]
- Ports are used to differentiate multiple services on the same device. On the exam you may encounter questions about well-known ports (e.g. port90 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS) and their associated protocols.
- understanding the concept of ports and their significance in network security is essential. For example, you should know how firewalls use port filtering to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Security implications of the transport layer: use of encryption protocols (e.g. TLS/SSL) to secure data in transit and the potential attacks like [[MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack]] targeting data transmitted at this layer
- Other Transport Layer attacks include [[SYN flood attacks (targeting TCP)]] and [[amplifications attacks (using UDP)]]
