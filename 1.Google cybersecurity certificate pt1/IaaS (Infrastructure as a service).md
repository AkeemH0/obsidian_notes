Refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the [[CSP (cloud service provider)]]. These include virtual containers and storage that are configures remotely through the CSP's [[API (Application Programming Interface)]] or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability performance and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.
