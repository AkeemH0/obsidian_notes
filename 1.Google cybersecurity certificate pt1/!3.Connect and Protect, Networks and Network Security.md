[[Network]]
[[IP (Internet protocol)]]
[[MAC (Media Access Control) address]]
[[LAN (Local Area Network)]]
[[WAN (Wide Area Network)]]
entry level tasks:
- using command lines
- log parsing
- network traffic analysis

Common devices:
- [[Hub]]
- [[Switch]]
- [[Router]]
- [[Modem]]
- [[WAP (wireless access point)]]

Hubs and switches both direct traffic on a local network. Hubs repeat all information out to all ports so they are vulnerable to eavesdropping thus most organizations use switches instead. Switches are more secure as they contain a MAC address table which matches MAC addresses of devices on the network to port numbers on the switch and forwards incoming data packets according to the destination MAC address meaning the flow of packets to devices is selective.


# Network operations


[[Virtualization tools]] can carry out many of the functions performed by the physical network devices.
Devices can communicate via sending [[packet]] wirelessly or through wired connection. 
A [[Network interface]] sends and receives packets.

[[Network diagrams]] are [[topographical]] maps that show the devices on the network and how they connect. This helps network administrators to visualise and design their organizations network effectively.
[[Cloud computing]]
[[Cloud network]]

Cloud service providers offer:
- On-demand storage
- Processing power 
- Analytics: business and web analytics that organizations can use to monitor their web traffic and sales

[[on-premise networks]]

[[CSP (cloud service provider)]]

benefits of [[Cloud computing]] & [[SDN (Software-defined networking)]]:
- Reliability: based on how available cloud services and resources are, how secure connections are & how often the services are effectively running. Cloud computing allows employees and customers to access the resources they need consistently and with minimal interruption 
- Cost: Since CSPs have such large data centres they are able to offer virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required for companies to install, parch, upgrade and manage the components and software themselves.
- Scalability: allows companies to pay for what they need when they need it depending on customer demand compared to over committing to equipment and software that may go unused due to decrease in demand. Changes can be made quickly through CSPs, [[API (Application Programming Interface)]] or web console

[[packet sniffing]]

[[TCP,IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol)]]

When data packets are sent and received across a network they are assigned a [[port ]]

[[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)]]



[[Protocol]]

[[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]]

if you want to access https://www.yummycookies.co.uk your device will establish communications with the web server via [[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]] , once a connection has been verified via a handshake a request is made to the network, the website servers respond to the request by sending packets back to your device. To get from the server to your device the packets must travel across routers, this is where the [[ARP (address resolution protocol)]] comes into play to ensure the packets reach the right place. [[HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)]] allows your web browser to securely send a request for a webpage to the yummy cookies webserver. [[DNS (Domain Name System)]] sends the domain name and web address to a [[DNS server]] that attempts to retrieve the IP address of the website you are trying to access which is then sent back to your web browser.

# Security hardening

- [[Security Hardening]]:
     Can be implemented in:
    - Hardware Devices
    - Databases
    - Operating systems
    - Networks
    - Applications
    - Cloud infrastructure
    - Security analysts may carry out: Patch updates (software updates) & backups
    - Physical security e.g. cameras & security guards
[[OS hardening]]
[[Network Hardening]]
[[cloud hardening]]


companies can run tests on their networks by utilising [[VM (Virtual machine)]] & [[sandbox]]es to assess vulnerabilities, check suspicious files or simulate a cybersecurity incident e.g.[[penetration test]], [[brute force attack]]
