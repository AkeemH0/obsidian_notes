A combination of a [[Boot Sector virus]]  and a [[Program virus]]
Launches from boot sector & then infects files or executables with its code so that it can remain a persistent threat.
Even if the virus is detected and cleared out from the file or executable it will still remain in the boot sector and reinfect the file & vice versa
