When a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection ([[MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack]]) and intercepts data, alters data or redirects packets.
- E.G. intercepting a transmission that contains a DNS system look-up and then spoofing the DNS response from the server and redirecting a domain name to a different IP address, perhaps one that contains malicious code or other threats.
- To protect against an On-path attack you could use encryption such as [[TLS (Transport Layer Security)]]
- malicious actors can packet sniff the communication and pretend to be either of the devices for malicious activity such as sending malware or gaining SPII
