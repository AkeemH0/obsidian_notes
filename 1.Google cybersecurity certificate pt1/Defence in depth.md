A layered approach to [[vulnerability management]] that reduces [[risk]]
An organisation should have multiple security controls that address threats and risks in different ways e.g. [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]] , firewalls, intrusion detection systems & permission settings . 
model layers
1. Perimeter layer: (e.g. usernames and passwords) user authentication layer that filters external access, only allows trusted partners to reach the next layer of defence
2. Network layer: (e.g. network firewalls)
3. Endpoint: (devices that have access on a network(e.g. devices & servers)), anti-virus software can protect these technologies
4. Application layer: (includes all the interfaces that are used to interact with technology) (e.g. [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]])
5. Data layer: (critical data that must be protected e.g. [[PII (Personally identifiable information)]] & [[SPII (Sensitive Personally identifiable information)]]]) ([[Asset classification]] is crucial here)
