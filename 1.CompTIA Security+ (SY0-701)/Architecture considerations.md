- [ ] Availability: System uptime, measured in nines 
- [ ] Resilience: maintaining availability/recovering quickly, measured in [[MTTR (Mean Time to Recover)]]
- [ ] Cost: Installation cost, maintenance cost, replacement/repair costs, tax costs (operating or capital expense)
- [ ] Responsiveness: Essential for interactive applications, speed is an important metric
- [ ] Scalability: Elasticity, quickly increase/decrease capacity to optimize resource usage
- [ ] Ease of deployment: consider parts required for deployment: web server, database, caching server, firewall, hardware resource, cloud budgets etc.
- [ ] Risk transference: transfer risk to a third-party e.g. cybersecurity insurance, recovers financial losses but not reputational damage
- [ ] Ease of recovery: How easily you can recover systems
- [ ] Patch availability: Ensure you're running the latest version. Test patches and then deploy throughout [[Change management]].
- [ ] Inability to patch: Embedded systems, legacy systems, optimal to implement additional security controls such as a firewall
- [ ] Power: foundational for systems, Backup services ([[UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)]], [[Power Redundancy]], generators)
- [ ] Compute: processing/processors (called compute engine in cloud)
