Security awareness training:
- Ideally provide security training before providing access to networks/devices
- Training is often specialised (based on role)
- Also applies to third parties: contractors, partners, suppliers 
- Keep detailed documentation and records on who has/hasn't received training

- [ ] Document security policy/handbooks that can be accessed easily 
- [ ] Users should be trained to have situational awareness (always looking for threats such as phishing, malicious links, USB baiting, unsecure doors etc.)
- [ ] [[Internal threat actors]]
- [ ] [[password standards]]
- [ ] [[Removable devices (threat vector)]]
- [ ] [[social engineering]]
- [ ] Operational security: educate users to view security from the attackers perspective, identify sensitive data and provide additional security for the sensitive data
- [ ] Hybrid/remote work: 
      - Working at home brings a new set of security risks e.g. family and friends accessing their work devices/applications
      - implement additional endpoint security e.g. [[MDM (mobile device management)]], [[VPN (Virtual private network)]]
