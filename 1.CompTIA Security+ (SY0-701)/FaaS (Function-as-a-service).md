Allows developers to run individual functions or pieces of code in response to events without managing the entire infrastructure (Cloud provider takes care of scaling and execution)
Applications are separated into individual autonomous functions
independent of OS
Only need to be run when needed or can be event triggered
Managed by third-party so all OS security concerns are at the third-party
Allows developers to write and deploy individual functions or pieces of code in response to specific events without managing the entire infrastructure
functions are usually event driven e.g. scripts that run to check for updates automatically
*Like using a powered device in your house, you don't need to understand the power grid; you plug in the device (write the functions code) & you just flip the power switch (executes function) and the device comes on (to carry out the function) so you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure*
