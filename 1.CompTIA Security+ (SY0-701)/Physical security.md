Bypassing/disabling surveillance systems :
 - Visual obstruction : Blocking cameras LOS using paint, stickers, mirror, foam, objects etc.
 - Blinding sensors and cameras: overwhelming the sensor or camera with a sudden burst of light to render it ineffective for a limited period of time
 - Acoustic interference: Jamming (emit certain frequencies to disrupt the microphones functionality) or playing loud music to disrupt the microphones functionality
 - Electromagnetic interference: Jamming the signals that surveillance systems rely on to monitor the environment. EMI generators or jammers to disrupt certain frequencies such as the Wi-Fi frequency band
 - Physical environment attack: Adjusting the environment of the surveillance equipment to compromise its functionality e.g. changing facility temperature or cutting the power supply
 Countermeasures:
 - Tamper alarms: devices set off an alarm when they are being tampered with e.g. cars & cameras
 - Backup power supplies or [[UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)]]
 - Encrypt frequencies to guard against jamming and eavesdropping
