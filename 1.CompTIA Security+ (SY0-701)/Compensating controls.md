Alternative temporary controls used when existing/desired controls aren't feasible or effective
*we'll use this for now*
- Block access instead of patching a program
- disabling problematic services
- limiting external access
- Separation of duties
- Require multiple security staff
- Power generator
E.G. using a legacy system that can only use [[WPA2]] therefore you use a VPN as a compensating tool to give an additional layer of security until you can upgrade your systems to utilize [[WPA3]]
