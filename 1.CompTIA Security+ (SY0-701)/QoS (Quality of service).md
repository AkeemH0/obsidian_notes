A set of techniques and mechanisms used in networks to improve the quality and reliability of communications
- Traffic Prioritization: Can prioritise specific traffic (e.g. based on protocol or other packet features) to ensure critical applications receive necessary resources
- Bandwidth allocation & reservation: Can reserve bandwidth for specific types of traffic & manage bandwidth allocation (reserving bandwidth for critical services/applications)
- [[flow control]]: can control the rate of data transmission
- Congestion management: Can apply policies that control how traffic is handled during periods of high demand to ensure calculated distribution of resources e.g. to prevent one type of traffic from dominating the network (example of one type of traffic dominating network: [[DOS attack against TCP connections throughout ICMP (with network access)]])
