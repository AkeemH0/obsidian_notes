The copying of data from an RFID or NFC card or [[Access badge]] onto another card or device
1. Scanning: Using handheld RFID or NFC reader (may be disguised in backpack) (1-2 inches for NFC, 2-10 inches for RFID depending on antenna strength)
2. Data extraction: extract relevant authentication credentials
3. Writing to a new card: Transfer onto blank RFID/NFC card or compatible device
4. Using a cloned access badge : attacker can now use badge to gain unauthorized access
- Easy to execute
- Ability to be stealthy when conducting the attack
- Potentially large use in compromising physical security
Countermeasures:
- Implement advanced encryption 
- Implement [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]]
- Regularly update the security protocols: periodically updating encryption keys and authentication mechanisms
- Educate the users
- Implement the use of RFID shielding wallets or sleeves 
- Monitor and audit access badge logs
