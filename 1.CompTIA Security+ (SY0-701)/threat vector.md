Summary:
 *how of the attack*
 The specific pathway/method throughout which an attacker gains unauthorized access to a network or device to carry out malicious activities such as delivering a malicious payload
 *the specific method/path that could be taken to exploit potential vulnerabilities (hypothetical)*

Threat vector vs attack vector:
 Threat vector and attack vector are often used interchangeably but have a slight difference:
 - [[threat vector]]: the method/path that could be taken to exploit potential vulnerabilities (hypothetical)
 - [[Attack vector]]: the techniques/actions used to exploit the vulnerability (practically)

Threat vectors:
 - [[Message-based (threat vector)]]
 - [[Image-based (threat vector)]]
 - [[File-based (threat vector)]]
 - [[Voice calls (threat vector)]]
 - [[Removable devices (threat vector)]]
 - [[Vulnerable software (threat vector)]]
 - [[Unsupported systems and applications (threat vector)]]
 - [[Use of unsecured networks (threat vector)]]
 - [[Open service ports (threat vector)]]
 - [[Default credentials (threat vector)]]
 - [[supply chain attack]]

Defending against threat/attack vectors:
 1. Educating users e.g. advising employees about a new phishing exploit
 2. Applying [[Principle of least privilege (POPL)]] 
 3. Using the right [[Security Controls]] and tools e.g. antivirus software
 4. Building a diverse security team
