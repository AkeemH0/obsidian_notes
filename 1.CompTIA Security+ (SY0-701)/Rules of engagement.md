Guidelines that dictate the terms of interaction between an organization and its potential vendors:
- Communication protocols
- Data sharing policies
- Negotiation boundaries

E.G. for a penetration test:
- IP address ranges
- Emergency contacts
- Handling sensitive information
- Testing times
- In-scope & out-of-scope systems/devices/applications
