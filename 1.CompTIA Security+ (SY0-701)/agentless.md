- agentless monitoring tools collect data from devices without requiring the installation of specific software on each endpoint device (done throughout protocols like [[SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)]])
- No software required on each device (e.g. web based applications) (software is on central server/network instead)
- Compromised central server could impact the monitoring process and expose data stored on the central server
- less intrusive than an agent
- less impact on system performance than an agent
- rely on network connections to be able to collect information from devices
- can scan for vulnerabilities without direct system access
