A strategic plan to Match supply to demand
Too much demand: application outage/slowdown, reputationally costly
Too much supply: resource waste, financially costly
- people: Too many, too costly & inefficient. Too little, inability to carry out essential business operations.
- technology: Use a scalable technology e.g. [[Load balancing]] for web services, [[server clustering]] for database services, Cloud services on demand (easily scalable, seemingly unlimited resources available at an instant for a cost)
- infrastructure: application servers, network services, CPU, storage, physical devices. Cloud-based devices/infrastructure are easier to deploy and more scalable to capacity changes compared to physical devices/infrastructure
