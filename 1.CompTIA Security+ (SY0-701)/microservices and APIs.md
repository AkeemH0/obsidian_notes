[[API (Application Programming Interface)]]
API is the glue for the microservices
API and [[microservice]]s work together to act as the application
Scalable: microservices can be added as needed
Resilient: The outage of one microservice doesn't effect the others
Security and compliance: microservices are separated therefore easier to implement appropriate security measures for each one separately
