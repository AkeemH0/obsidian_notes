Using multiple cloud services/platforms to reduce reliance on a single cloud service/platform.

Benefits:
- Flexibility and redundancy: no single point of failure
- Risk mitigation: provider outages, security incidents & change in service offerings are less impactful as reliance is spread.
- Optimized performance: different cloud providers excel in different services/regions.
- Cost optimization: compare & choose services offered by different cloud providers leading to better cost efficiency.
