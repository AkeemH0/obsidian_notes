systematically examining a network or system for vulnerabilities 
(crucial as vulnerabilities are constantly discovered)
- OS type and version
- Device driver version
- Installed applications
Gather scanned details and aggregate into a database for analysis/reporting. (often lots of raw details so database will help sift for important information)
