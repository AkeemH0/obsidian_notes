**Definition:**Â 
 A collection of vulnerability communication standards used to enhance security automation and improve the consistency of security information.

Security alerting and monitoring tools ((e.g. [[NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)]], [[IPS (Intrusion prevention system)]] & [[vulnerability scanner]]s)) all have different ways of evaluating threats therefore [[SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)]] is used as a standardized protocol for vulnerability communication.

Helps maintains the security of systems by allowing systems to identify and assess vulnerabilities using standardized communication, reducing complexity of monitoring security alerts from different security tools.
Also allows for the improved implementation of automation as tools will communicate in the same language/standard so configurations could be made for remediation systems to immediately patch/solve the issue.
