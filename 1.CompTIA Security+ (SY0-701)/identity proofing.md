Confirming a user is who they say they are
- Resolution: who does the user claim to be?
- Validation: evidence of claim (password, [[Biometrics]], security questions, [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]] etc.)
- verification/attestation: further verifying, double-check claim (e.g. passport/ in-person meeting)
*meeting a friend online: resolution: say who they are, validation: show you picture, attestation: join video chat*
