summary:
 Malware that can self-replicate and spread itself across systems without user interaction
 Worms use an infected device as a host, scan the connected network for other devices & infect everything on the network without requiring action to trigger the spread

 Can cause disruptions to normal network traffic since they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network - which can result in a [[DoS (Denial of service)]] attack
 Often spread through [[email phishing]]
 Attackers often target devices, drives or files that are shared access over a network
