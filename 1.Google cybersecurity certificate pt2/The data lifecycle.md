data vulnerabilities are mapped using the data lifecycle model.
Each stage of the lifecycle plays an important role in the security controls used to maintain the [[CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad]] of information.
Influences how security teams set policies that align with business objectives.
Also makes the technologies security teams use more accessible.

- Destroy/disposal
**[[data governance]] policy:** 
Outlines how information will be managed across and organization.
These documents clearly define procedures that should be followed to participate in keeping data safe. They place limits on who or what can access data. Security professionals are important participants in data governance. As a data custodian, you will be responsible for ensuring that data isn't damaged, stolen or misused.

Protecting a person's data privacy decisions must always be respected.
data owners often generate more data than they can manage so data custodians and stewards sometimes lack direct instructions on how they should handle specific types of data.
Governments and other regulatory agencies have bridged this gap by creating rules that specify the types of information that organizations must protect by default.

- [[PHI (protected health information)]]
- [[SPII (Sensitive Personally identifiable information)]]
