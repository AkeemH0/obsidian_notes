**Definition:**Â 
 The fundamental suite of protocols providing communication over the internet.

[[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]] & [[IP (Internet protocol)]]
A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network via network [[Protocol]]s
Layers: (Bottom=1 Top=4)
1. [[1.Network access Layer (TCP,IP)]]
2. [[2.Internet Layer (TCP,IP)]]
3. [[3.Transport Layer (TCP,IP)]]
4. [[4.Application Layer (TCP,IP)]]

The [[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)]] visually organizes network protocols into different layers thus network professionals often use this model to communicate with each other about potential sources of problems or security threats when they occur.
TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model (TCP/IP model contains 4 Layers whilst the OSI model contains 7 Layers), both models define standards for networking and divide the network communication process into different layers.
