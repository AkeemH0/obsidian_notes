A technology that enables the transmission of electrical power along with data over Ethernet cables. This allows [[IP cameras]] , [[IP phones]] , [[WAP (wireless access point)]] and other networked devices to receive both data connectivity and electrical power from a single Ethernet cable, simplifying installation and reducing the need for separate power sources 
- standardized under the IEEE 802.3af & IEEE 802.3at standards also known as PoE and PoE+ respectively. These standards specify the maximum power that can be delivered over Ethernet cables and the techniques for safely transmitting power.
- Eliminates the need for separate power adapters and electrical outlets for connected devices. Instead, power is supplies by a PoE-enabled switch or PoE injector located at the network switch or patch panel.
- PoE devices are classified into two main categories:
- [[Powered Devices (PDs)]]
- Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
