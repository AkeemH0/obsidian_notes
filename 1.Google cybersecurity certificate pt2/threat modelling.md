The process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities and how each is exposed to threats
A strategic approach that combinates [[vulnerability management]], [[threat analysis]] & [[IR (Incident response)]]
1. Define the scope: create inventory of assets and classify them
2. Identify threats: define all potential [[threat actor]]s & put together a detailed [[Attack tree]]
3. Characterize the environment: apply an attacker mindset to the business (consider how the customer and employees interact with the environment as well as external partners and third party vendors) 
4. Analyse threats: team works together to examine existing protections and identify gaps and rank threats according to the risk score that they assign (likelihood * impact = risk)
5. Mitigate risks: create plan for defending against threats - avoid risk, transfer it, reduce it or accept it.
6. Evaluate findings: Everything done during the exercise is documented, fixes are applied and the team makes note of any successes they had. They also record any lessons learnt so they can inform how they approach future threat models.

Should be performed before, during and after an application is developed. Should be incorporated at every stage of the [[SDLC (software development lifecycle)]]

The right model depends on the situation and the type of risks an application might face
Threat modelling frameworks:
- [[PASTA]]
- [[STRIDE]]
- [[Trike]]
- [[VAST]]

its crucial to ask the right questions during threat modelling e.g. what are we working on, what kinds of things can go wrong, what are we doing about it, have we addressed everything, did we do a good job.
