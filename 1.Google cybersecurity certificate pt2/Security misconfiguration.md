Misconfigurations occur when security settings aren't properly set or maintained.
Companies use a variety of interconnected systems & mistakes often happen when those systems aren't properly setup or audited.
- Open permissions
- Unsecured admin/root accounts - countermeasures: disable root/admin account login by making users login through their user accounts and then use sudo, restrict the amount of users with root privilege
- insecure protocols: [[Telnet]], [[FTP (File Transfer Protocol)]], [[SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)]], [[IMAP (Internet Message Access protocol)]]
- [[Default credentials (threat vector)]]
- [[Open service ports (threat vector)]]





E.G. when businesses deploy equipment like a network server using default settings which can lead businesses to use settings that fail to address the organizations security objectives.
