Also known as URL hijacking or cyber-squatting
When an attacker registers a domain name similar to a popular website but contains some common typos, replacement letters or a different subdomain
e.g. gnail.com, gmail.c0m, youtube.web
- Sell the misspelled domain name to the actual owner (owners usually will buy so they can set it to redirect to their actual website)
- Redirect misspelled domain name to competitor, not as common & legal issues
countermeasures:
 - organizations often register misspellings of their own domain names which redirects users to their actual website
 - conduct security awareness training
 - domain name providers may restrict names which are similar to popular brands
