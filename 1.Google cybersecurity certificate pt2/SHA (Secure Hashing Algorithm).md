**Definition:**Â 
 A family of cryptographic hash functions widely used in various security applications.

SHA-1:
-  SHA-1     (160 bit)
SHA-2: 64 to 80 rounds of computations to create digest
- SHA-224 (224 bit)
- SHA-256 (256 bit)
- SHA-384 (384 bit)
- SHA-512 (512 bit)
SHA-3: 120 rounds of computations to create digest
- 224 to 512 bit hash digest
These algorithms excluding SHA-1 are considered to be collision-resistant, however that doesn't make them invulnerable to other exploits.

SHA-1 is used to verify that a file has been unaltered by producing a checksum before the file has been transmitted and then again once it reaches its destination.
SHA-2 is used in authentication and encryption protocols including [[SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)]], [[TLS (Transport Layer Security)]], [[IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)]], [[SSH (Secure Shell)]]. 
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin use SHA-2 for verifying transactions
