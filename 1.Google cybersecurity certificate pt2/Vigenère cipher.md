 Encryption 
  - Write the key underneath the plaintext
  - We take the plaintext letter at the top and the key letter on the left
  - The cross section of those two letters is the cyphertext
 Decryption
  - Take the key letter on the left and find the ciphertext letter in that row
  - The plaintext letter is at the top of the column where you found the ciphertext letter
