- When an attacker sniffs an authorized user's [[IP (Internet protocol)]] address and floods it with packets.
- Combination of [[IP Address spoofing]] and [[DoS (Denial of service)]] attack to flood a network with unwanted traffic.
- The spoofed packets could include [[ICMP (Internet Control Message protocol)]] pings, so that a network becomes overwhelmed ([[ICMP flood Attack]]) and shuts down, bringing business operations to a halt
- Advanced [[Firewall]]s can prevent smurf attacks by monitoring unusual traffic on the network e.g. [[NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)]]s include features that detect network anomalies so that oversized broadcasts are detected and stopped before they have a chance to overload a network
