[[DoS (Denial of service)]]
Transmit interfering wireless signals: constant random or legitimate bits and frames, may be reactive (only occur when someone tries to use the network)
the attacker needs to be local
Decreases the signal to noise ratio at the receiving device so the device doesn't hear a strong signal
countermeasure:
fox hunting: using a directional antenna to find out where the signal is coming from
