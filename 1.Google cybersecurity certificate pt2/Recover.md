The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation e.g. restoring systems data and assets that have been affected by a breach such as financial or legal files.



Construct a plan and implement the framework for recovering and restoring affected systems and/or data:

- Recovery planning: How will resources be restored following an attack?Â 
    
- Improvements: Do any improvements need to be made to the current recovery systems or processes?
    
- Communications: How will restoration procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff?
