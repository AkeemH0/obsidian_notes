Data travels through closed loop bi-directionally until it reaches its destination. Each node passes the data to the next node ensuring the data reaches its target.

Advantages:
 - Performs better than bus topology in heavy data traffic
 - No central node needed
 - Easy to install and configure (adding/deleting nodes only requires 2 connection  changes)
 - Error checking and repair can be done easily due to its point-to-point structure

Disadvantages:
 - If a single node/wire fails the network fails
 - If nodes are added the transmission time increases (longer transmission delay)
 - Bandwidth is shared across all connections between devices
