Uses a single secret key to encrypt & decrypt
makes web communication less secure as key interception will result in all communications being decipherable 
faster than [[asymmetric encryption]] due to less overhead
keys are smaller than those used in asymmetric encryption
keys should be frequently regenerated to maintain security (should have an expiry/lifecycle)
