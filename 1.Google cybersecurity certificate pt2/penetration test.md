A simulated attack carried out by [[pen testers]] that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications and processes
Involves the same tools and techniques as malicious actors in order to mimic a real life attack.
Must have a [[Rules of engagement]] set before carried out
Ethical hacking since it is an authorised attack
A pen test exploits weaknesses whereas a [[vulnerability assessment]] locates weaknesses.
[[penetration testing]] helps determine potential consequences if the system breaks or gets broken into by a threat actor, allowing security teams to address weaknesses based on severity in order to improve the security of an organization.

Organizations regulated by [[PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)]] , [[Health Insurance Portability And Accountability (HIPAA)]] OR [[GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)]] must routinely perform penetration testing to maintain compliance standards.
