Evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats.
Threat intelligence sources:
- [[Industry reports]]: Organizations Include details about attacker's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP)
- [[Government advisories]]: government advisories include details about attackers TTP
- [[Threat data feeds]]: Provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like [[APT (Advanced persistent threat)]].
- Organizations can utilize a threat intelligence platform (TIP) which is an application that collects, centralizes and analyses threat intelligence from different sources. Allows organizations to identify and prioritize relevant threats to improving their [[security posture]].
- By adding context to [[IoC (indicators of compromise)]] , security teams can start to develop a detailed picture of a security incident e.g. identifying other artifacts related to the suspicious IP address such as suspicious network communications or unusual processes.
- [[Crowdsourcing]]
- Used to improve the detection methods and techniques of security products like detection tools or anti-virus software. e.g. attackers often perform the same attack on multiple targets simultaneously. Once an organization detects an attack they can publish the attack details to tools like Virus Total to help other organizations defend against the same attack.

Facilitates risk management
Hardening can reduce incident response time
Insight to [[TTP (Tactics Techniques & Procedures)]] & [[threat map]]

Note: Threat intelligence data feeds are best used to add context to detections. They shouldn't drive detections completely & should be assessed before applied to an organization.
