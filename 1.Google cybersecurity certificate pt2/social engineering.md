Summary:
 A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables
Common Motivational triggers:
 (Multiple motivational triggers can be used simultaneously to social engineer)
 - Authority - pretending to be someone in a position of control e.g. important client, manager, government agency
 - Urgency - creating an urgent situation e.g. pretending to be late for a meeting so you get let in, someone asking you to urgently print out files from a USB 
 - Social proof - Using the behaviours/actions of people to trick others e.g. getting people to spread the word about something malicious, getting someone to break security policies/procedures because other employees do
 - Scarcity - Tricking someone to believe a product, opportunity or resource is in limited supply, e.g. only n spots left for a deal
 - Likability - being likeable to gain the victims trust e.g. sexual attraction, pretending to be a friend, common interest
 - Fear - scaring people into doing something e.g. Files will be destroyed in 2 hours, this system has a virus clear now, this is the government pay this overdue tax to ... etc.

Preventing social engineering:
 - Implementing managerial controls: policies, standards & procedures e.g. Following certain [[NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)]] standards
 - Staying informed of trends
 - Sharing your knowledge on social engineering attacks with others
 - Stay alert of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email e.g. look for spelling errors and double-check the sender's name and email address.
 - [[Anti-phishing campaign]]
 - Be cautious about sharing information, especially over social media as threat actors often search these platforms for any information they can use to their advantage
 - Control curiosity when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails and advertisements.
 - Implementing technologies like [[Firewall]]s, [[MFA (Multi-factor authentication)]], block lists & [[email filtering]] could help throughout [[Defence in depth]].
