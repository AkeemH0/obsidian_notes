A secure [[Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)]]protocol
- Addresses the authentication handshake vulnerability to [[KRACK attack]]s which are present in [[WPA2]]
- Uses [[GCM (Galois Counter mode)]] & [[Galois message authentication code (GMAC)]]
- Encrypts traffic with  [[AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)]] as packets travels from your device to the WAP. 
- Uses [[SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)]], a password-authenticated, cipher-key-sharing agreement. Preventing attackers from downloading data from wireless network connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.
- Has increased encryption to make passwords more secure by using 128-bit encryption, with WPA3-Enterprise mode offering optional 192-bit encryption
- Also utilises personal mode & enterprise mode
