The subdivision of a network into smaller subnetworks/[[subnet]]s.
- It helps manage IP address allocation efficiently and enhances network security.
- The smaller subnets form based on the IP address and network mask of the devices on the network
- Subnetting creates a network of devices to function as their own network, making the network more efficient & the network can be used to create [[Security zone]]s. 
- If devices on the same subnet communicate with each other, the switch changes the transmissions to stay on the same subnet, improving speed and efficiency of the communications.
