Nodes are connected to a backbone that allows for bidirectional connection. Every node receives transmitted data even if it does not belong to it.
No transmission priority.

Advantages:
 - Easy to add nodes
 - Good for small networks
 - Extending the bus is easy
 - Cheap since Single cable needed

Disadvantages:
 - High probability of packet loss
 - Performance may suffer as bandwidth is shared among all nodes in the network, could result in network crashing
 - The rate of being affected by errors in the network is high
 - If there is a break in the main cable the network is divided into two and problems arise with packet transmission
