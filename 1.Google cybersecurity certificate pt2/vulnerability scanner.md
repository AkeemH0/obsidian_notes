Software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network.
Tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or programming flaws.
Used to analyse each of the five attack surfaces in the [[Defence in depth]]
The scanning tool compares the findings against databases of security threats & at the end of the scan the tool flags any vulnerabilities that it finds and adds them to its reference database.
Each scan adds more information to the database, helping the tool be more accurate in its analysis.

While vulnerability scanners are non-intrusive (unlike a penetration test), there are instances when a scan can inadvertently cause issues like crash a system.

Update to latest signatures before using to reduce [[False negative]]s
Often scan for open ports & identify vulnerable systems/devices
Can perform: application scans, web application scans, network scans
can identify: 
 - lack of security controls: no firewall, no anti-virus, no anti-spyware 
 - misconfiguration: open shares, inadequate access controls
 - vulnerabilities

External & internal scans simulate an attackers approach
[[external scan]]
[[internal scan]]

Authenticated & unauthenticated scans simulate whether or not a user has access to a system.
[[Authenticated scan]]
[[Unauthenticated scan]]

Limited & comprehensive scans focus on particular devices that are accessed by internal and external users.
[[Limited scan]]
[[Comprehensive scan]]
[[Discovery scanning]] should be done prior to limited or comprehensive scans
