1. Define business and security objectives: decide what goals are e.g. protecting customer data, team asks lots of questions & understand things such as how PII is handled
2. Define the technical scope: identify the application components that must be evaluated ([[attack surface]]). Includes data at rest, data in use, network protocols, security controls and other data interactions
3. Decompose the application: identify the existing controls that will protect user data from threats. Working with the application developers to produce a data flow diagram to show how data gets from a user's device to the company's database & identify the controls in place to protect this data along the way.
4. Perform a threat analysis: ([[attacker mindset]]) research is done to collect the most up-to-date information on the type of attacks being used & the current [[attack vectors]]
5. Perform a vulnerability analysis: The team more deeply investigates potential vulnerabilities by considering the root of the problem
6. Conduct attack modelling: test analysed vulnerabilities by creating an [[Attack tree]]
7. Analyse risk and impact: assemble all information collected through stages one to six & make informed risk management recommendations to business stakeholders
