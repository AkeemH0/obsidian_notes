come up with a story/pretext in order to fool the victim into giving information 
Common Steps:
 1. Prepare: gather information on target, use intel to find best way to exploit target
 2. Establish trust: open a line of communication & establish a false sense of trust
 3. Use persuasion tactic: manipulate target into volunteering information - often done by using specific vocabulary that makes them sound like a member of the organization
 4. Disconnect from the target: break communication with target to cover tracks
 
countermeasures:
- Employee training (on pretext & filling in gaps for people calling (verify everything))
