**Definition:**
 An outdated security protocol for wireless networks, easily compromised and no longer considered secure.

Wireless security protocol designed to provide users with the same level of privacy on wireless network connections as they have on wired network connections.
Largely out of use today as there are more secure protocols so WEP is considered a high-risk security protocol.
Considered insecure due to IV attack vulnerability (once the number of packets transmitted on a network becomes sufficiently large there is a high probability of reusing IVs & IVs are sent in plaintext with each packet. Attackers can conduct statistical analysis to decipher parts of & eventually the whole secret key. Attackers can then decrypt all further traffic using the discovered secret key.
