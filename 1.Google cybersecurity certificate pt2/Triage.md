The prioritizing of incidents according to their level of importance or urgency.
Incidents are triaged according to the threat they pose to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems.
The triage process helps security teams evaluate and prioritize security alerts and allocate resources effectively so that the most critical issues are addressed first.
1. Receive and assess:
2. Security analyst receives an alert from [[IDS (Intrusion detection system)]] & reviews it to verify its validity & get a complete understanding. This involves gathering as much information as possible about the alert such as the activity that triggered the alert & the systems and assets involved. Questions to consider: Is it a false positive, has this alert been triggered in the past, is the alert triggered by a known vulnerability & what is the severity of the alert.
3. Assign priority: To manage time and resources, teams must prioritize how they respond to various incidents. Factors to consider:
    - Functional impact: how an incident impacts the existing business functionality of the affected system(s).
      Information impact: The effects that information compromise can have beyond the organization e.g. data belonging to third party users or organizations.
      Recoverability: Consider whether recovery is possible and consider whether it's worth the time and cost. e.g. proprietary data being leaked publicly is likely unrecoverable.
4. Collect and analyse: 
 Collecting evidence from different sources, conducting external research and documenting the investigative process. so make an informed decision on how to address the incident e.g. whether it needs escalating.

Benefits:
Resource management: triaging allows security teams to focus their resources on threats that require urgent attention without wasting time and resources on low priority tasks. 
Standardized approach: triaging provides a standardized approach to incident handling to ensure incidents are consistently handled effectively.
