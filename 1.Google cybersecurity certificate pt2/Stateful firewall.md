- A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats.
- Stores analysed information & discovers suspicious trends. 
- More secure than stateless firewalls.
- Stateful firewalls only require a rule in one direction unlike [[Stateless firewall]]s since stateful firewalls utilize a state table to track connections so it can match return traffic to an existing session.
