ports direct data to the specific service or process on a device whilst [[Protocol]]s outline the rules for communication
- used by network devices to determine what should be done with the information contained in each data packet once they reach their destination.
- [[Firewall]]s can filter out unwanted traffic based on port numbers
- An organization may configure a firewall to only allow access to TCP port 995 (POP3) by IP addresses belonging to the organization ([[whitelist]])
- [[ARP (address resolution protocol)]]]doesn't use port numbers since its confined to the local network segment
- A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.
- Non-physical locations on a computer that organize data transmission between devices on a network
- socket address = IP address: Port number e.g. 192.168.5.100:443
- Ports divide network traffic into segments different segments require different processing & different prioritization.
Port protocols that facilitate communication include: 
- [[Transmission control protocol (TCP)]]
- [[UDP (User Datagram Protocol)]]
- Each port can use either or both of the protocols
[[Port numbers]]
Network admins can change default ports

*like a rule labelled (protocol) container (port) for transporting data*
The container (port) helps organize and direct incoming data to a specific service or process.
The rule label (protocol) defines how the data in the container should be handled to ensure a standardized communication process.
the service/processes occur at the application layer and are the underlying infrastructure that enables the program to function
