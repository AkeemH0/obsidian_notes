The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and [[attack surface]] by limiting its points of entry
  Can be implemented in:
    - Hardware Devices
    - Databases
    - [[OS (operating system)]]
    - Networks
    - Applications
    - Cloud infrastructure
    - Security analysts may carry out: Patch updates (software updates), backups and changes to security configurations e.g. more complex passwords or more frequent password changes
    - Physical security e.g. cameras & security guards
    - Removing unused applications, services , ports & hardware
    - reducing access permissions
    - Conduct regular [[penetration test]]s
    - [[Network Hardening]]
