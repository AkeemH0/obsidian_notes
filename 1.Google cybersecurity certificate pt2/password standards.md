Dictate the complexity and management of passwords
- Minimum length
- Mix of lower and upper
- Special characters
- Numbers
- Regular password changes e.g. every 90 days (depends on system importance)
- Prohibit password reuse
- entropy (unpredictable)
- [[Hashing]]
- [[Salting]]
Using a password manager can help implement these features with reduced complexity.
Passwordless methods: (Biometrics, security keys)
Often implemented administratively using Group Policy
