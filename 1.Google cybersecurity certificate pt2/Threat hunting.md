The proactive search for threats on a network.
Used to uncover malicious activity that was unidentified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections
Used to detect threats before they cause damage
E.G. fileless malware is difficult for detection tools to identify as it uses sophisticated evasion techniques such as hiding in memory instead of using files or applications, allowing it to bypass traditional methods of detection like signature analysis.
With threat hunting, the combination of active human analysis and technology is used to identify threats like fileless malware.

[[Threat]]s evolve and attackers advance their tactics and techniques meaning that automated, technology-driven detection can be limited in keeping up to date with the constantly evolving threat landscape.
Human-driven detection like threat hunting combines the power of technology with a human element to discover hidden threats left undetected by detection tools.
