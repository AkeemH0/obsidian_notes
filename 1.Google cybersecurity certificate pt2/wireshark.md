[[wireshark settings guide]]
open source [[packet sniffer]] that utilises a [[Graphical User Interface (GUI)]]
[[length (wireshark)]]
- Display filters: let you apply filters to packet capture files. Useful when inspecting packet captures with large volumes of information. Help to find specific information based on packet properties e.g. protocols, IP addresses, ports etc.
- Comparison operators: utilised to locate specific header fields and values. Can be expressed via abbreviations or symbols:
Symbol  | Abbreviation
    ==       eq
    !=         ne
    >          gt 
    <           lt
    >=        ge
    <=         le
You can combine comparison operators with Boolean logical operators like AND & OR to create complex display filters. Parentheses **()** can also be used to group expressions and prioritize search items

- `Contains` operator: used to filter packets that contain an exact match of a string of text.
- e.g.![[Pasted image 20231114132343.png]]
- `Matches` operator: used to filter packets based on the [[regular expression (regex)]] that's specified. Regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern.

- Filter toolbar: allows filters to be applied to packet capture e.g. filtering by protocol (dns, http, ftp ,ssh, arp, telnet, icmp)
- e.g. ![[Pasted image 20231114132539.png]]

Filtering for an IP address:
`ip.addr == ___` filters packets containing a specific IP address
`ip.src == ___` filters packets originating from a specific source IP address
`ip.dst ==___` filters packets delivered to a specific destination IP address
Filtering for a MAC address:
`eth.addr ==___` filters packets containing a specific MAC address
`eth.src == ___` filters packets originating from a specific source MAC address
`eth.dst == ___` filters packets delivered to a specific destination MAC address
Filtering for ports:
`udp.port == ___` filters packets for a specific UDP port
`tcp.port == ___` filters packets for a specific TCP port

Follow streams: a feature that lets you filter for packets specific to a protocol and view streams. A stream/conversation is the exchange of data between devices using a protocol. Wireshark reassembles the data that was transferred in the stream in a way that's simple to read.
e.g. ![[Pasted image 20231114133400.png]]
Useful when trying to understand the details of a conversation. E.G. you can examine the details of an HTTP conversation to view the content of the exchanged request and response messages.

[[SYN flood attacks (targeting TCP)]] resulting in the server unable to provide service for legitimate users

**Indications of error:**

- **HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Time-out (text/html)** error message. Generated by a gateway server that was waiting for a response from the web server, if the web server takes too long to respond, the gateway server will send a timeout error message to the requesting browser.
![[Pasted image 20230919144641.png]]


- \[RST,ACK] packet, sent to the requesting visitor if the \[SYN,ACK] packet is not received by the web server. RST stands for reset. The visitor will receive a timeout error message in their browser and the connection attempt is dropped. The visitor can refresh their browser to attempt to send a new SYN request

[[DoS (Denial of service)]][[SYN flood attacks (targeting TCP)]] (since all the SYN requests are coming from 1 [[IP (Internet protocol)]] however this is probably a spoofed IP ([[IP Address spoofing]]) as attackers want to stay anonymous)
![[Pasted image 20230919145132.png]]

practice 2:
- **No.**Â : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
- **Time**: The timestamp of the packet
- **Source**: The source IP address
- **Destination**: The destination IP address
- **Protocol**: The protocol contained in the packet
- **Length**: The total length of the packet
- **Info**: Some information about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark
- packets are coloured differently depending on protocols
