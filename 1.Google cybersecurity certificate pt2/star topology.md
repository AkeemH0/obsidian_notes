Each node connected to a central node (switch or hub)
All data flow done through central node

Advantages:
 - Disconnecting nodes doesn't effect other nodes
 - Adding or removing nodes doesn't effect network operation (good scalability)
 - Provides good performance under heavy traffic
 - Suitable for large networks with lots of devices

Disadvantages:
 - Costly due to cabling needed for each node to be connected to central node
 - Failure of central node results in network failure
