definition
 an address assigned (by [[ISP (Internet Service Provider)]] and Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)) to a device on a public network such as the internet.  
 - Globally unique allowing devices to communicate with each other across the internet.
 - Costs to lease public IP

purpose
 Public IP addresses are essential for identifying devices on the public internet as they enable the routing of data over the internet.

assignment:
  [[ISP (Internet Service Provider)]]s assign public IP addresses to their customers either dynamically (changed periodically e.g. on router reset) or statically (fixed)

Security implications:
 public IP addresses are more exposed to potential security threats and attacks from the internet therefore they are subject to security measures such as [[Firewall]]s and [[IDS (Intrusion detection system)]]
