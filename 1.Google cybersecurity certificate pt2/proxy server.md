A server that fulfils the requests of a client by forwarding them on to other servers.
- Sits between the internet and the rest of the network
- Proxy servers utilize [[NAT (Network address Translation)]] to serve as a barrier between clients on the network and external threats
- Acts as an intermediary between a network and the internet
- When a request to connect to the internet from the network or connect to the network from the internet comes in the proxy determines whether the connection request is safe alike to a firewall e.g. websites identified as possibly containing malware will be blocked
- The proxy server has its own IP address so it adds a layer of security as the users IP cannot be seen
- can be used to block unsafe websites that users aren't allowed to access on an organizations network 
- Uses temporary memory to store data that's regularly requested by servers, which enhances security by reducing contact with the internal server & increases processing speed as the data doesn't need to be fetched again from the server
- Types of proxy servers:
   - [[Forward proxy server]]
   - [[Reverse proxy server]]
