Making sure that the proper procedures are eased to contain, neutralize & analyse security incidents and implement improvements to the security process e.g. collecting and organizing data to document and incident and make improvements to processes to prevent the incident from happening again




Design action plans for responding to threats and attacks:

- Response planning: What action plans need to be implemented to respond to similar attacks in the future?
    
- Communications: How will security event response procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff?
    
- Analysis: What analysis steps should be followed in response to a similar attack?
    
- Mitigation: What responding steps could be used to mitigate the impact of an attack, such as offlining or isolating affected resources?
    
- Improvements: What improvements are needed to improve response procedures in the future?
