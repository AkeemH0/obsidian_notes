**Definition:**Â 
 A storage technology that combines multiple disk drives into a logical unit for data redundancy and performance improvement.

A storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit to provide improved performance, data redundancy or a combination of both.

There are different RAID levels that depend on the required balance between performance & redundancy and the number of available disk drives

RAID 1 mirroring (each disk holds identical data)
RAID 5 striping (each disk holds identical data with a parity bit and is stripped across (so the bits across different disks don't line up))
RAID 10
