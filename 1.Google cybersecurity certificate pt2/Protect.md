The strategy used to protect and organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats e.g. studying historical data of cyber security threats & making improvements to policies and procedures.


Develop and implement safeguards to protect the identified items and ensure delivery of services:

- Access control: Who needs access to the affected items? How are non-trusted sources blocked from having access?
    
- Awareness/Training: Who needs to be made aware of this attack and how to prevent it from happening again? 
    
- Data security: Is there any affected data that needs to be made more secure?
    
- Information protection and procedures: Do any procedures need to be updated or added to protect data assets? 
    
- Maintenance: Do any of the affected hardware, operating systems, or software need to be updated? 
    
- Protective technology: Are there any protective technologies, like a firewall or an intrusion prevention system (IPS), that should be implemented to protect against future attacks?
