The internal review process of an organizations security systems
Goal is to identify weak points and prevent attacks
how security teams determine whether their security controls reach regulatory standards
organizations security teams performs, evaluates, scores and fixes vulnerabilities
1. identification : scanning tools ([[vulnerability scanner]]) and manual testing
2. Vulnerability analysis: test found vulnerabilities to find the source of the problem
3. Risk assessment: score vulnerability (severity of impact x likelihood), helps to prioritise resources based on vulnerability score
4. remediation :  fix vulnerabilities e.g. enforcing new security procedures, updating OS or implementing system patches


e.g.
1. A vulnerable server is flagged because its running an outdates operating system (OS)
2. Research is done on the outdated OS and its vulnerabilities
3. After doing your due diligence, the severity of each vulnerability is scored and the impact of not fixing it is evaluated.
4. Finally, the information that you've gathered can be used to address the issue
