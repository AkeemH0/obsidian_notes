A type of electrical cable used for transmitting data signals in telecommunications and computer networking. They consist of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together in a helical pattern. The twisting of the pairs helps reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI)and [[crosstalk]] , making them suitable for high-speed data transmission.

**Structure:**
- Pairs of insulated wires: Twisted pair cables contain multiple pairs of insulated copper wires. Each pair consists of two wires of contrasting colours (e.g. white and blue twisted together).
- Twisting Pattern: The pairs are twisted together in a specific pattern which helps reduce interference and electromagnetic radiation. The number of twist per inch can vary depending on the cable type.
- Outer Insulating jacket: The entire cable is covered by an outer insulating jacket, which provides protection and structural integrity to the cable.

**Types**:
- [[UTP (Unshielded Twisted pair)]]
- [[Shielded Twisted pair (STP)]]
**Connector Types:** 
- Twister pair cables use connectors at the ends to connect to network devices. RJ-45 connectors are commonly used with Ethernet twisted pair cables.
- 
**Applications:** Twisted pair cables are widely used in networking, including Ethernet connections in homes, businesses and data centres. They are also used in telephone systems and for other data transmission purposes.

**Advantages:** Twisted pair cables are cost-effective, relatively easy to install, and capable of carrying data over both short and long distances. Their twisted configuration helps reduce interference, making them suitable for high-speed data transmission.

**Limitations:** The maximum data transmission distance and speed of twisted pair cables can be limited compared to other cable types such as optical fibre. Signal loss and cross talk can occur over long cable runs.

In summary, twisted pair cables are common type of electric cable used for data transmissions in [[telecommunications]] and networking. They consist of twisted pairs of insulated copper wires and come in both unshielded (UTP) and shielded (STP) varieties. Twisted pair cables are widely used in Ethernet networks and telephone systems due to their cost-effectiveness and ability to reduce interference.
