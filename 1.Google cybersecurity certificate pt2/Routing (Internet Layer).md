The internet layer is responsible for determining the most efficient path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination. This process involves routers, which make forwarding the decisions based on the destination [[IP (Internet protocol)]] address, routers maintain [[routing table]] to determine the best path for data transmission. Routing protocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) & [[BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)]] are essential for maintaining network routing tables and ensuring efficient data transmission.
