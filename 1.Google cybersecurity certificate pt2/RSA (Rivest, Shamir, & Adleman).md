**Definition:**Â 
 A widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm for secure data transmission.

- one of the first [[asymmetric encryption]] algorithms that produce a public and private key pair.
- RSA key sizes are 1024  , 2048 or 4096 bits.
- Used to protect highly sensitive data
- Used for key exchange, encryption and digital signatures
- Uses large prime numbers to increase algorithm complexity
- Commonly used for secure communications
- used for generating and verifying digital signatures
