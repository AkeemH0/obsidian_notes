Immediate one-time delivery of the malicious script
When an attacker injects a malicious script into a web application & sends the URL to a victim & the scripts are reflected back to the victims browser.
The Malicious code is embedded in the URL, form or other input fields & executed by the victims browser when they access the modified link allowing the attacker to gain sensitive information such as cookies/session IDs/credentials or conduct session hijacking.

e.g. the search bar of a website: threat actors send their target a weblink that appears to go to a trusted website but when they click the link it sends a HTTP request to the vulnerable site server, the attackers script is then reflected back to the innocent user's browser (The browser loads the malicious script because it trusts the server's response). information like session IDs/cookies & credentials are sent back to the attacker
