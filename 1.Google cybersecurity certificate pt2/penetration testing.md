simulating a cyberattack against a system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities
An effective security plan relies on regular testing to find an organizations weaknesses.
Must have a [[Rules of engagement]] set before carried out

General process:
- Carry out [[vulnerability assessment]] to create [[penetration test]] attack strategies based on found weaknesses
- Exploit vulnerabilities to get into network
- move laterally ([[lateral movement]])
 set up a [[Backdoor]] (build user accounts, change passwords etc.) ([[APT (Advanced persistent threat)]])
- Gain access to systems that wouldn't normally be accessible by using vulnerable system as a [[proxy]]/[[relay]] & exfiltrate data
