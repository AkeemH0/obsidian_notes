Definition
 - An address assigned to a device (by network admins) within a private network, typically a [[LAN (Local Area Network)]]. 
   Theses addresses are: 
 - not [[routable]] on the public internet 
 - only unique within the private network
 - free of cost

Purpose 
 - used for internal communication within a network allowing devices within the same LAN to communicate.

Some IP address ranges are privatised:
 - IPv4:

 - IPv6:
  - Addresses starting with "fc00::/7"  

can utilise [[NAT (Network address Translation)]] to communicate with the public internet

security implications
-  private IP addresses are not directly accessible from the internet and therefore are generally more secure than public IP addresses.
- firewalls for [[Packet Filtering]] or [[blacklisting]]
